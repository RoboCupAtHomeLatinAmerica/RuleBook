\section{Special Penalties}
\label{sec:rules:penaltiesbonuses}

\subsection{Missing Test Slot}
\label{sec:rules:missingslot}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Announcement:} If a team cannot participate in a test (for any reason), the team leader has to announce this to the \abb{OC} at least \SI{30}{\minute} before the \Testblock{}.

	\item \textbf{Penalties:} If a team is not present at the start position when their \Testslot{} starts, the team is not allowed to participate in the test anymore. If no announcement was made, the team gets a penalty of \scoring{\penaltysmall points}.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Extraordinary Penalties}
\label{sec:rules:extrapenalties}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Cheating:} If a team member is found breaking the fair play rules (see~\ref{sec:rules:fairplay}), the team will be automatically disqualified of the running test, and a penalty of \scoring{\penaltybig points} is handed out.

	\item \textbf{Faking:} If a team starts a test, but it does not solve any of the partial tasks (and is obviously not trying to do so), a penalty of \scoring{\penaltysmall points} is handed out.
	The decision is made by the referees and the monitoring TC member.

	\item \textbf{Collisions:} In case of major, negligent collisions the team will be automatically disqualified of the running test, and a penalty of \scoring{\penaltybig points} is handed out.

	\item \textbf{Volunteer Attendance:} If a \Volunteer{} is not at the arena on time, the team receives a penalty of \scoring{\penaltysmall points}.
	
	\item \textbf{Jury Attendance:} Jury members missing a performance to evaluate are excluded from the jury, and the team is disqualified from the test.

	\item \textbf{Modifying Standard Platform Robots:} If any unauthorized modification is found on a \SPL{} robot, the responsible team will be immediately disqualified for the entire competition while also receiving a penalty of \scoring{\penaltybig points} in the overall score.
\end{enumerate}
\noindent\textbf{Note:} Receiving these penalties might negatively influence future qualification decisions.
