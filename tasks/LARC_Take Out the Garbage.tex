\subsection*{Focus}
	This task focuses on 
	\textit{Object Perception},
	\textit{Object Manipulation} and
	\textit{Task Planning}

\subsection*{Setup}
\begin{itemize}[nosep]	
	\item \textbf{Locations:}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item This test takes place inside the \Arena{}.
			\item The robot starts inside the \Arena{} at a predefined location near the entrance door.
