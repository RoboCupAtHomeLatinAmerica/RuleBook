\section{Object Recognition and Manipulation}
\label{test:object-recognition-and-manupulation}

\subsection*{Description}
The robot must reach a collection location (bookcase with shelves or table) in which there are 10 objects. The robot must then identify and grasp 5 of those objects and put those into a delivery location (another shelf or another table).

\noindent \textbf{Main goal:}
The robot has to identify, grasp and correctly place several objects at different heights or positions.

\noindent \textbf{Optional goal:}
Finding a hidden or occluded object

\subsection*{Focus}
This task focuses on
\textit{object detection},
\textit{object recognition} and
\textit{object manipulation}

\subsection*{Setup}
\begin{itemize}[nosep]	
	\item \textbf{Locations:} 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item This task takes place inside the \Arena{}.
		\item The robot will start at a random distance between 1.0m and 1.5m from the collection location .
	\end{itemize}	 
	\item \textbf{People:} 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item There is no people in this task.
	\end{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Furniture:} 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item One of the bookcases or tables in the apartment is used for this test.
	\end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Objects:} 
    \begin{itemize}
		\item Objects are randomly organized at the collection location and by category at the delivery location.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Procedure}
	\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
		\item The referee requests the team to move the robot to the start location.
		\item The referee gives the start signal and starts the timer.
		\item The team leaves the area after the start signal.		
		\item The referee follows the robot ready to press the emergency stop button.
		
		\item The robot approaches collection location and starts searching for objects.
		\item \textbf{Optionally}, the robot can search for hidden or occluded objects.
		\item Any object found by the robot may be grasped by it. 
		\item Before or right after grasping the object, the robot has to announce which object it has found.
		\item After grasping the object, the robot has to safely place it on the delivery location.
		\item Scores can only be gained a single time for each specific object.
		
	\end{enumerate}





\subsection*{Additional rules and remarks}
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
	\item Slightly touching the shelves, the bookcase or the table is tolerated. Driving over the objects or any other form of a major collision is not allowed, and the referees directly stop the robot.
	\item Robots must create a PDF report file including the list of recognized objects with a picture showing the object and the object name/label. This file may be stored on a USB-stick on the robot which is given to the OC after the test. The PDF file name should include the team name and a timestamp. It must be unmistakable which label belongs to which object. Objects must also be recognizable in the report by a human (OC) so that it can be scored. An overview of the shelf with bounding boxes and labels attached to the bounding boxes is handy for the TC to score. False positives in the report (labeling an object which is not an object but e.g. the edge of the shelf) are penalized.
	\item A post-it with constrasting colors can be glued to the front of the object to create occlusion.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Instructions:}
\subsubsection*{To Referee}

The referee needs to:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Place the objects in the collection and delivery locations.
	\item Make sure there is space to place objetcs. 
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{To OC}
The OC needs to:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{2 hours before the test:} Select and announce the robot start location.
\end{itemize}
