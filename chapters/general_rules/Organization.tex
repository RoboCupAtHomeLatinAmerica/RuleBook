\section{Competition Procedure}
\label{sec:rules:competitionprocedure}

A \RoboCup\AtHome{} competition consists of the following stages:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Poster Section:} Scientific presentation made by the team during \SetupDays{}.
% 	All registered teams can participate.

	\item \textbf{\RobotInspection{}:} For security, robots are inspected during \SetupDays{}.
	All registered teams must participate.

	\item \textbf{\SONE{}:} First set of tests, assessing the robot's basic abilities .
% 	Only teams that passed the \RobotInspection{} can participate.

	\item \textbf{\STWO{}:} Second set of tests, assessing more complex abilities and behaviors.
% 	The best \SI{50}{\percent} of teams\footnotemark{} (after \SONE{}) can participate.
% 	\footnotetext{If the total number of teams is less than 12, up to 6 teams may advance to \STWO{}}

	\item \textbf{\FINAL{}:} An open demonstration, asking teams to showcase complex behaviors and novel approaches. 
% 	The two best scoring teams (\SONE{} and \STWO{} combined) can participate.
\end{enumerate}

% \noindent In case of having no considerable score deviation between a team advancing to the next stage and a team dropping out, the \TC{} may announce additional teams advancing to the next stage.

% \subsection{Scenarios}
% \label{sec:rules:scenarios}
% The tests in \SONE{} and \STWO{} are divided in two thematic scenarios:
% \begin{itemize}
% 	\item \textbf{\Housekeeper{}:} Features tests related to cleaning, organizing, and maintenance.
	
% 	\item \textbf{\Partyhost{}:} Focuses on providing general assistance during a party by attending the needs of the guests.
% \end{itemize}


% \subsection{Schedule}
% \label{sec:rules:schedule}
% There are two \Testblocks{} in a competition day. Each block has a stage and one or two thematic scenarios assigned. An exception is the \emph{Restaurant} test (see~\ref{test:restaurant}) which has its own block. During a block, each team has at least two \Testslots{} available, where they can choose which test, fitting the stage and scenario, they want to perform. The teams must inform the \OC{} which tests they will perform a day prior, usually in the \TLM{} (see~\ref{sec:rules:teamleadermeeting}). Teams have to indicate to the \abb{OC} when they are skipping a \Testslot{}. Without such indication, they may receive a penalty (see~\ref{sec:rules:missingslot}).

% \noindent\textbf{Note:} The schedule will be announced during \SetupDays{} (see~\ref{chap:setupdays}) by the \abb{OC}.


\subsection{Team Leader Meeting}
\label{sec:rules:teamleadermeeting}
In the evening before each competition day, a \TLM{} is held. 
Attendance from all teams participating in the next day's tests is mandatory. 
During the meeting, teams can ask questions and discuss the upcoming tests with the \abb{TC} and \abb{OC}. 
The starting time will be announced by the \abb{OC}. 
Decisions made in the \TLM{} are binding. 
The \abb{TC} and referees on site will decide on anything coming up during or after a test.

\subsection{Scoring System}
\label{sec:rules:scoringsystem}
Each test has a main objective and a set of bonuses.
% To score in a test, a team must accomplish the main goal (in parts if allowed). 
Bonuses are only given if at least \SI{50}{\percent} of the points for the main goal are achieved. 
Overall scoring in a stage is calculated as the sum of the maximum score obtained in each test. 
% The final score is calculated differently and is normalized (see~\ref{sec:finals:scoring}). 
A team cannot get a negative score for a test.
% unless a penalty was received.

\paragraph*{Note: } Once a scoresheet has been signed by the team leader or the scores have been published, the \abb{TC} decision is irrevocable.
